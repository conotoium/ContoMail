## Reason
Many email clients just feel, look and seem outdated, not utilising many more modern technologies. The reason behind this is the age old Ideaology of "If its not broken, dont fix it".
I want to fix this and make a modern, seamless and fluid experience to provide better user experiences for email clients.

# Goals:
- [ ] Create fluid and effective base for client
- [ ] Enable a simple and effective importation and exportation of email settings.
- [ ] Create integratability with other email systems.
- [ ] Ensure secure user data storage
- [ ] Create a way for effective app integration into the system.
- [ ] Add a way for effective email storage.

# Features
Again, a wip. See [Goals](#Goals), above.


# Installation
Because this is a wip, Installation atm is simplw to just grab this repo and run it.
